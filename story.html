            <h1>sheikh saadi</h1>
            The king of Iran used to invite the great poet Sheikh Saadi very often to his court. Once on his way to the king’s court the poet took shelter in a nobleman’s house for a night. He was then wearing a very ordinary and cheap dress. The nobleman could not recognize him and did not behave well with him. On the next day, Sheikh Saadi left the place for the court of the king and was received with honour there. He stayed there for a few days, and received rich gifts from the king. On his way back to home he again visited that nobleman’s house wearing a costly and gorgeous dress. This time, the nobleman treated him with the best of the foods and comfort. While eating, he was surprised to see the rich delicious food and understood the nobleman’s attitude. Sheikh Saadi then instead of eating the food, started putting them into the pockets of his rich dress. Being astonished, the nobleman asked him about his mysterious behaviour. The poet answered that the given food was for his dress as he failed to receive same hospitality when he was in very simple dress. The nobleman realized his earlier folly and became ashamed. He begged pardon to Saadi and also promised that he would never judge anyone by their dress. Being a kind-hearted man Saadi forgave him.

            <h1>unity is strength</h1>
            There was an old farmer in a village. He had four sons. They were all teenagers. However, they had a difficult relationship among themselves. They were disobedient and often quarreled among themselves. The old man was quite unhappy with them and tried to bring them together, but they avoided him. He became upset about their future as he became older and weaker. Finally, he found a new plan to teach his sons how to live together in harmony. To execute his plan, he ordered his sons to meet one day and said, “I have brought you to share my last advice.” I won’t be alive for long. “But it makes me very sad to watch you fighting among yourselves.” He told his eldest son to bring some sticks. The son brought some sticks, and the old man told him to join them. He bundled them together. The old man then told him to break the bundle. He tried but failed, to break it.

The old man ordered all of his sons to break the bundle one by one. They tried their best but failed. The old man then ordered his sons to untie the bundle. When they were done, he ordered them to separate the sticks and break each of the sticks. Now they easily broke the sticks one by one. The old farmer stood up and said, “My sons!” Take a lesson from it. When the sticks were tied together, you couldn’t break them. But it wasn’t hard for you to break the single sticks. If you are united like sticks and do not quarrel, no one can harm you, but if you quarrel among yourselves, you will lose strength, and the enemy will easily harm you. “So live in peace and tranquility.” The sons understood and agreed to follow their father’s advice. The father was happy and prayed to Allah for their prosperity.
